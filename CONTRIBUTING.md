## What to contribute

The following things would be appropriate to contribute and will be well received.

### Missed topics 

If you can think of a topic that comes up on internals regularly that isn't already documented here, please either suggest it, or even better, write a document for it.

### Missed problems

If one of the topics listed has another problem with it that has been missed, that would need to be overcome before the topic could be progressed.

### Typos or other small improvements 

Speeling is hard.


## What not to contribute

The following things are not appropriate to contribute, and won't be well received here.

### Why I'm wrong and X is a good idea

This documentation isn't to stop ideas....it's to make people aware of what the challenges are for certain ideas, so that we can avoid having people thinking that 'those internals people' haven't considered X, and to avoid the same discussions over and over.

### Cunning plans to over come these problems

If you have a cunning plan to make one of these 'blocked' RFCs happen, I'd suggest either discussing it with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrDanack) or the PHP [chat room on Stackoverflow](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php). 

This repo is just for documenting the problems RFC face.
