# RFC etiquette

There are some behaviours that I see people do when discussing RFCs, and other software projects (both open source, and closed source) that I think are either subtly but incredibly rude, or otherwise do not help people have a productive conversation.



## Don't volunteer other people for a fuckton of work


## Don't say that other people's use cases are invalid
