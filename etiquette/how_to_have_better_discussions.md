## Talk about problems before talking about solutions



See also, the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem).


## Don't ask "why don't we just?"

"Asking why don't we just" is almost always a bad way of finding a solution, as it puts the onus on other people to find reason against an idea, and so allows 'ungood' ideas to slip through. In PHP, the conversation should always be "we'll do this, because it's the right solution".

In other projects, that don't have a fixed release schedule or such a large user-base, and are more willing to making BC breaks, using temporary solutions can useful in exploring the problem space.

## Don't respond to ideas you don't like the same day

It's quite normal for people to have instinctive negative reaction to a proposal. If you respond the same day as you first read a proposal, it seems you are likely to 'bake in' you negative reaction to the idea, and it becomes permanent.

If you leave a day or two to pass before responding, the idea probably won't seem quite so bad, and you'll be slightly more open to having a productive discussion.
