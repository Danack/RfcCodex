So, being told you've been violating an etiquette rule probably doesn't feel that great.

It might feel like you've been told off. It might feel like someone is making an unreasonable request for you to change your behaviour.

Those feelings are quite normal. Congratulations on having a normal human response.

Almost by definition most someone pointing out an etiquette violation seems quite confrontational, as someone is complaining about some behaviour that you thought was okay. So now try to relax a bit, and have a few things to consider:

### It's not unusual

Most people have at some point in their career been given advice about how to behave in a way that is slightly more considerate to other people.

Consistently communicating with other people, without being deeply annoying, is much harder than most people realise. In lieu of a full explanation of the problem, here is a section from a Douglas Adam's novel.

> The problem with the valley was this. The Monk currently believed that the valley and everything in the valley and around it, including the Monk itself and the Monk’s horse, was a uniform shade of pale pink. This made for a certain difficulty in distinguishing any one thing from any other thing, and therefore made doing anything or going anywhere impossible, or at least difficult and dangerous. Hence the immobility of the Monk and the boredom of the horse, which had had to put up with a lot of silly things in its time but was secretly of the opinion that this was one of the silliest.

> So what of this horse, then, that actually held opinions, and was sceptical about things? Unusual behaviour for a horse, wasn’t it? An unusual horse perhaps?
>
> No. Although it was certainly a handsome and well-built example of its species, it was none the less a perfectly ordinary horse, such as convergent evolution has produced in many of the places that life is to be found. They have always understood a great deal more than they let on. It is difficult to be sat on all day, every day, by some other creature, without forming an opinion on them.

> On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to sit all day, every day, on top of another creature and not have the slightest thought about them whatsoever.


It is very, very easy for someone to just be completely unaware of the burden that someone else is carrying.

This is particularly true in open source projects:

* there is far more drudgery work to be done than 'fun' stuff. For Imagick, most of the issues people report are issues related to their machine being not configured correctly (e.g. bad file permissions, not recompiling Imagick after updating ImageMagick itself), rather than an issue with the code I have written.
* most open source projects have far fewer contributors than users expect. I repeatedly have had issues opened with the phrase "Hello team", as if there is a whole team of people monitoring the repo.
* Maintainers usually put far more work in to avoid problems for their users than the users realise. e.g. [The PHP core developers are lazy, incompetent idiots](https://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/core-developers-are-idiots.html) 

If this doesn't make sense to you....congratulations, you probably aren't an Open Source maintainer! And are probably a happier person than the typical Open Source maintainer.

Just try to be kinder. 

### They want you to improve

If someone has taken the time and mental energy to engage with you and give you advice about how to avoid breaking etiquette rules, they probably[^gatekeeping_is_a_thing] want to help you improve so that you can contribute to the project without being a burden on the other maintainers.

If they hated you, and wished that you just fucked off from contributing to the project, they would just be complaining about your bad behaviour to the other maintainers where you couldn't see it.

When someone puts some effort into trying to help you, it behooves you to put some effort into trying to be a better person.

### They might be wrong

There is always a small (but definitely non-zero) chance that someone giving you etiquette feedback is just straight up wrong. They possibly misunderstood the situation, the relationships of the people involved or whether something is an inside joke.

For example, the phrase ["Why you so fucking ugly bro?"]() would, on the face of it, appear to be offensive. But in the context it was said, it is _absolutely hilarious_.

Because human relationships and communication is fractally complex, it is always possible for it to be misinterpreted, and someone to think that someone said something inappropriate when it was actually fine.

When this happens, there are a couple of different paths you can take:

* ask them to explain if you don't understand why it's an etiquette violation.
* If you have a closer relationship with the person who the etiquette offence was against, than the person complaining, explain that it's an in-joke.
* say "noted" and move on with your life. Someone who complained might just be wrong.

[^gatekeeping_is_a_thing]: Although most people who use the phrase "Social Justice Warrior" are unpleasant tedentious assholes who fail at basic empathy, at the same time, there is a phenomenon of well-meaning people who want to improve the world and think they will do so through restricting certain usage of language, which actually inhibits useful communication.

As previously stated, human relationships are fractally complex. People trying to enforce simple rules are probably not helping as much as they hope they are.
