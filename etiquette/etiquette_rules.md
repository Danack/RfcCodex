# List of etiquette guidelines for PHP 

Hi. If someone has linked you to this page, you might want to check the [How to handle etiquette feedback page](how_to_handle_etiquette_feedback.md), before you get angry with them.

## Basic level

### Taking up other's time

### Changes need a motivation not be a whim

### Being unwilling to explore the ideas of other people

Multiple people involved with the PHP project have a consistent pattern of pooh-poohing suggestions from other people, and almost always suggesting their own solution to the same problem.

This is incredibly tedious.

It would be okay if they were actually going and starting the work on that idea.....but they don't. They just sit there pooh-poohing away, and expect other people to see the brilliance of their own insights...

### Your gut instincts/aesthetics might be wrong

TODO ....


### Discussing draft work before it's published

The site [wiki.php.net/rfc](http://wiki.php.net/rfc) is a tool that is meant to allow people to draft RFCs and share the idea with other people who want to work on the RFC before it is a polished idea, and before it is ready to be presented to the world.

### Getting involved in conversations you don't understand

A not uncommon pattern in technical discussions is this:

* two competent people, who both understand the problem, are disagreeing about how it should be solved.
* another person sees that conversation happening, but isn't up to speed on the problem.
* that person tries to get involved in the conversation suggesting solutions or asking questions.

In general, drive-by advice is much less useful than you might imagine.

When the person who is trying to get involved isn't actually up-to-speed on the problem, it becomes a real hindrance to solving the people for the people who are up-to-speed.  

If the conversation is at all heated, having an uninformed person join the conversation is likely to make the knowledgeable participants to enjoy the conversation even less.

## Don't volunteer other people for huge amounts of work

Users always want more stuff.

They also always imagine that:

* life would be so much better for everyone if only open source maintainers worked a little bit harder.

* doing some things is going to be easy.

<!-- 

The response to some RFCs has been to suggest that the RFC doesn't cover enough scope, and that the RFC author should make the RFC be a lot bigger.

While that sounds reasonable on the surface, the amount of time people have to work on PHP RFCs is often limited. Having someone say "thanks for volunteering, but now I want you to do a lot more work than you volunteered for" is a subtle way of preventing RFCs from being implemented.

In some cases the suggestion to make the RFC be bigger has been well-intentioned, and so the damage has been accidental.

In other cases, it would seem that the suggestion that the RFC needs to be a lot bigger or not done at all has come from someone who doesn't want the RFC to pass, which could be interpreted as deliberately making it more difficult for the RFC to pass.

It's okay for RFCs to be small in scope, so long as they are self-contained.

It would only be appropriate to say that the RFC needs to be bigger if it would otherwise leave new inconsistencies in the language that would need to be resolved before the next release. -->

## Meta level

### Not picking up etiquette rules

### When told to do something, don't say no

Ask "why?" and try to understand.

### Arguing in the wrong place

### Don't try to be funny in a heated conversation

Particularly don't do this if you haven't been bearing the weight of the conversation.

Heated conversations can actually be useful....but only if they reach a resolution.

Having someone wade into a conversation with a positive emotional state, when the original participants have a strong negative emotional state is a great way of disrupting the conversation, and making the people involved want to walk away from communicating in that place.
