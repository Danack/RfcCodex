# List of etiquette guidelines for PHP 

Hi. If someone has linked you to this page, you might want to check the [How to handle etiquette feedback page](how_to_handle_etiquette_feedback.md)

## Basic level

### Taking up others time

### Changes need a motivation not be a whim


### Being unwilling to explore the ideas of other people

At least one person involved with the PHP project has a consistent pattern of pooh-poohing other people's suggestions, and almost always suggesting their own solution to the same problem.

This is incredibly tedious.

It would be okay if they were actually going and starting the work on that idea.....but they don't. They just sit there pooh-poohing away, and expect other people to see the brilliance of their own insights...

### Your gut instincts/aesthetics might be wrong




### Discussing draft work before it's published

The site [wiki.php.net/rfc](http://wiki.php.net/rfc) is a tool that is meant to allow people to draft RFCs and share the idea with other people who want to work on the RFC before it is a polished idea, and before it is ready to be presented to the world.

### Getting involved in conversations you don't understand

A not uncommon pattern in technical discussions is this:

* two competent people, who both understand the problem, are disagreeing about how it should be solved.
* another person sees that conversation happening, but isn't up to speed on the problem.
* that person tries to get involved in the conversation suggesting solutions or asking questions.

In general, drive-by advice is much less useful than you might imagine.

When the person who is trying to get involved isn't actually up-to-speed on the problem, it becomes a real hindrance to solving the people for the people who are up-to-speed.  

If the conversation is at all heated, having an uninformed person join the conversation is likely to make the knowledgeable participants to enjoy the conversation even less.

## Meta level

### Not picking up etiquette rules

### When told to do something, don't say no

Ask "why?" and try to understand.

### Arguing in the wrong place
