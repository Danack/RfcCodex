**RFC name**

Either a link to the RFC if it is available on a webpage, or a link to the discussion on https://news-web.php.net/group.php?group=php.internals

** Summary ** 

If you provide a brief summary of the discussion, that can help me get it added.

Please note the 'RFC codex' section is an opinionated curation. i.e. I'm not going to document some of the discussions that were had that were either for things that were a bad idea, or just so unlikely to happen that curating them isn't likely to be worth anyone's time reading them.
