# JIT performance tests.

We should do some benchmarking of the JIT before launching PHP with it...


## Notes

[JITs are un-ergonomic](https://abe-winter.github.io/2020/03/28/jitu-brutus.html)


## Projects to test

From [/r/php](https://en.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/fozbw2/im_already_loving_php_8/fljf60p/) and user [prgmctan](https://en.reddit.com/user/prgmctan).
