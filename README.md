# RfcCodex


There are some notes on PHP RFCs, why some were declined, and what others might need for them to be implemented.

The purpose of these documents is to avoid information from being last, or needing to be repeated multiple times on PHP internals.

## Things still be discussed 

[Consistent callables](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/consistent_callables.md)

[Method overloading](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/method_overloading.md)


# Ideas that overcame their challenges

[Co- and contra-variance](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/co_and_contra_variance.md)


## Disclaimer

I reserve the right to be as opinionated as I feel like when commenting on RFCs; I'm not going to attempt to stay neutral when talking about RFCs that I consider to be either dumb or bad for PHP.
