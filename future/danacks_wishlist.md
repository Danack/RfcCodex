Here are the things that I think would make great additions to PHP, and would

* [Closure self reference](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/closure_self_reference.md)
* [Chained comparison operators](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/chained_comparison_operators.md) 
* [String Template literals](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/template_literals.md)
* [Class method callable](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/class_method_callable.md)
* [Multiple return](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/multiple_return_type.md)
* [Type aliasing](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/type_aliasing.md)
* [Typedef callable signatures](https://github.com/Danack/FunctionTypes/blob/master/1_callable_type_rfc.md) or even fewer words https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/typedef_callables.md
* [Interface Default Methods](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/interface-default-methods)
* Function autoloading - being worked on already.
