# PHP Internals development info

This document lists some resources people may find useful to start to learn how PHP works internally, and what is involved in PHP extension development.

The information about what people could be working on is kept in a separate document at [PHP Project Coordination](https://github.com/Danack/RfcCodex/blob/master/project_coordination.md)

## PHP internals book 

This book is a collaborative effort between several developers of the PHP language to better document and describe how PHP works internally.

There are three primary goals of this book:

* Document and describe how PHP internals work.
* Document and describe how to extend the language with extensions.
* Document and describe how you can interact with the community to develop PHP itself.

## PHP extension sample

Thomas has put together a comprehensive set of example of how to implement many different features in a PHP extension.

Each of the examples are in a separate branch, so you can see precisely the work needed to add that particular feature.
