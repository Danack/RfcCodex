# PHP Internals development info

This document lists some resources people may find useful to start to learn how PHP works internally, and what is involved in PHP extension development.

## PHP internals book 

[www.phpinternalsbook.com](http://www.phpinternalsbook.com/) is a collaborative effort between several developers of the PHP language to better document and describe how PHP works internally.

The three primary goals of the book are:

* Document and describe how PHP internals work.
* Document and describe how to extend the language with extensions.
* Document and describe how you can interact with the community to develop PHP itself.

## PHP extension sample

Thomas has put together a comprehensive set of example of how to implement many different features in a PHP extension.

Each of the examples are in a separate branch, so you can see precisely the work needed to add that particular feature.
