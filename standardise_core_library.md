## General idea


## Hurdles to overcome



### Performance hit




### People have strong feelings for method overloading


Although some people like method overloading, my impression is that most people who have experienced method overloading / dynamic dispatch have come to hate it. 

### Lacking a strong reason

A really strong argument for why method overloading is a good thing needs to be made as well, particularly as
the equivalent behaviour can be done in userland.

None of the RFCs seem to have made a really clear case of why method overloading _needs_ to be included, rather than just be a 'nice to have'.


## Forecast

Not likely to ever happen.

## Notes

### Userland implementation

Method overloading is trivially implementable in userland.
